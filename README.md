# Currency-app

In order to check this app, you should:

1. ```git checkout currency-app```
2. ```cd Backend/```
3. Run ```npm install```
4. Run ```node server.js```
5. In a different terminal go to app/ (You'll probably need to ```cd ../app```)
6. Run ```npm install```
7. Run ```npm start```

Voila! You'll see the app running! :)
